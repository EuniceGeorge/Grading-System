# Project overview

The aim of the project is to develop Student Grading application that automates the calculation of current grades for each student in a class.

The project requires the .NET Editor as the code development environment. I'll be writing code that uses string and numeric variables, performs calculations, and displays results to a console.

## Parameters for the Application
- A short list of four students and their five assignment grades.
- Each assignment grade is expressed as an integer value, 0-100, where 100 represents 100% correct.
- Final scores are calculated as an average of the five assignment scores.
- The application will perform basic math operations to calculate the final grades for each student.
- The application will output/display each studentâ€™s name and final score.
